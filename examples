ideas:
* entity resolved(NER?)

* instead of selecting fixed(top-k) context paragraphs, rank them and use one by one until
confident in answer(and possibly keep context of previous paragraphs,
i.e assuming ranked context paragraphs are p1,p2,p3,....pn and we have QA model(QA):
 1) [text|p1|0|q] -> QA model -> answer. confident in answer?done else go to 2
 2) [text|p2|lstm(p1)|q] -> QA model -> confident? done : go to 3
 3) [text|p2|lstm(p2+lstm(p1))|q] -> ...
 that way we keep looking for a good paragraph while also not
 completly forgetting previous paragraphs read(actually, this is probably not needed questions in this datasets, as one paragraph should be suffice to answer?)
 lstm is just an example on how to it while keeping complexity linear with number of paragraphs.
